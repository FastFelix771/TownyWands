TownyWands is an Minecraft plugin that allows you to create highly customized GUI's (Inventories) that allows you to set custom items and bind commands to it.
You can add as many GUI's as you wan't, set the commands and permissions to whatever you wan't! 
When you see the name you may think it is an add-on for Towny, but it is not!
It was made as such, but it no longer depends on Towny, you can use it with any plugins you wan't, it even supports BungeeCord!

It supports 95% of all Minecraft languages and shows every GUI different to each player, depending on his Minecraft Language!

TownyWands is able to translate the GUI's you have configured before into all languages listed below if you enable the feature in the config.yml!
